Smartcar Code 
==
* Based on Freescale KL26 MCU.
* Use digital camera.
* Can start and stop by two dark lines,also can go around the barrier.But not stable due to the change of indoor threshold and the delay of scaning;
* Not very fast and the dynamic-threshold function is not working very well.
* May beacause the MCU is not very faster or I just use the library(acturally I didn't programe registers),or whatever.
* Uploaded just for backup.Welcome to bullshit! hiahiaiahia~
